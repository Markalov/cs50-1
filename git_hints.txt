$ git branch
	display branches available
$ git checkout {{branch_name}}
	switch branch to 'branch_name' 
$ git merge {{branch_name}}
	merge changes from one branch into another branch //lookout for conflicts! if(conflict) edit conflicting file(s) to resolve conflict
$ git branch -d {{branch_name}}
	delete branch 'branch_name'
$ git clone {{repo_url}}
    copies the code from a code repo into working directory //arguably not the best if you're *working* on the code
$ git pull {{repo_url}}
