BMP - 2^n where n is the number of bpp.  2^32 is the max.
JPG - (2^8)^3 (read RGB)
PNG - (2^8)^4 (read RGBA)
GIF - 2^8 per logical screen
1.  GIF is the only format which suports animation natively, by standard.
2.  Lossy compression sacrifices some quality when the original image size is made smaller, via a compression algorithm.  Lossless compression sacrifices no image quality in making the image's file size smaller.
3.  JPG images are lossy compressed.  The images come out smaller than most other formats, but some quality is sacrificed in compression of a JPG.
4.  When a file is deleted on a FAT file system, the filename's first character is changed to signal that the directory entry can be recycled. The second thing which happens is that all the clusters which comprise the data are moved to a section of "free clusters", or clusters that can be used in the future when space is needed.  The important takeaway being that technically the data isn't erased or corrupted, it's just put into a special spot on the hard disk which notifies the disk that it can use those bytes for other things when it needs more space..  The 0s and 1s which comprise the file are able to be recovered using special software or scripts written for that purpose.
5.  To ensure, with high probability, that my files are deleted beyond recovery from my hard drive, I could use freely available software to overwrite the bytes previously occupied by my files with either a constant byte (e.g. all zeroes) or a special pattern (e.g. Guttman pattern) designed to prevent recovery by even the most technically able.
